# Java Practical Sets - Week 2

## Practical Set 3: Functions and Methods

### Overview
This practical set focuses on functions and methods in Java, including recursion, mathematical operations, and string manipulations. The goal is to understand the importance of modular programming and function reuse.

### List of Practical Programs (Structured Order):

1. **a_SimpleMethod** - Implement a basic function demonstrating method declaration and calling.
2. **b_FactorialRecursion** - Compute the factorial of a number using recursion.
3. **c_PrimeCheck** - Check whether a number is prime using a function.
4. **d_PowerCalculation** - Calculate the power of a number using a user-defined function.
5. **e_DecimalToBinary** - Convert a decimal number to binary using a function.
6. **f_PalindromeString** - Check if a given string is a palindrome using a function.
7. **g_FindLCM** - Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers using a function.

### Notes:
- Each program demonstrates a unique concept of functions and modular programming in Java.
- The use of recursion and iterative methods are explored for problem-solving.
- String manipulation and mathematical computations are included for a deeper understanding of functions.
